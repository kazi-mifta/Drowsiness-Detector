# Drowsiness Detector
This Application Uses the OpenCV library to detect Eye Aspect Ratio and  alarms a sound if a person falls asleep during Driving. Facial Landmark detection is used in this application to locate eyes in the Video. If the Calculated Eye Aspect Ratio goes below a certain Level an alarm is played. A trained model is used here to detect the facial landmarks. I uploaded the .dat file in the repo.
